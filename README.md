# This project consists of 5 console math games.

## "Parity Check" (brain-even):

The essence of the game is the following: the user is shown a random number. And he should answer 'yes' if the number is even or 'no' if it is odd.

## "Calculator" (brain-calc):

The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example 32 + 18, which you need to calculate and write down the correct answer.

## "Greatest Common Divisor" (brain-gcd):

The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown two random numbers, for example, 3 9. The user must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

## "Arithmetic progression" (brain-progression):

The essence of the game is as follows: a player is shown a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression, in which one number is missing. The player must identify this number.

## "Prime Number" (brain-prime):

The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random number, for example, 11. The user must determine whether this number is prime.
